# Nixos adventure of a Silly lil Polish Mao

I was interested in Linux back in 2019, but was scared of it, mostly cuz of my school and teachers that made programming difficult to understand.
Years later, I've met a wonderful person that changed my perspective on life and I learned a lot about myself and was open to changes without fear of failing.
This year i was watching my Beloved Best Friend starting his Nixos adventure, he was comming to me with every little thing he discovered or did and seeing and hearing  him being so passionate about it, slowly started to create the idea of starting on my own.
I was watching him streaming for me hes work on his confing, i saw all the struggles he was going through, and despite that, i still was getting more and more interested on switching to Nixos.
Eventually, My Beloved Best Friend offered his Platinum Support Service if i would decide to switch to Nixos and... i said YES !

# Why Nixos ? 

simple, i liked how it works and looks and that was Dystro i was used to from all the hours i've spent on watching my Beloved Best Friend.
He's Really Smart, and with he's lvl of dedication there is nothing that stands in his way, i enjoy watching him grow <3
I Highly recommend checking his Git hub " https://github.com/different-name " i wouldn't be here if it wouldn't be for him.
