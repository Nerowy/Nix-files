# Nix-files

## Motivation

I was interested in Linux back in 2019, but have been afraid to learn more about it, mostly because of my school experiences that had made programming difficult to understand.

[different-name](https://github.com/different-name) has taken the role of a teacher and has changed my perspective on learning. I have greatly enjoyed seeing his level of passion for his work, and it pushed me to take the plunge.

### Why NixOS?

I'm found great interest in how NixOS functions and what can be achieved compared to other distributions. I want to learn more about NixOS
